      <title>Cantor&#39;s (No Longer) Lost Proof</title>

      <description>In preparing to cover Cantor&amp;rsquo;s proof of different infinite set cardinalities (one of my all-time favorite topics!) in our theory of computation course, I found various conflicting accounts of what Cantor originally proved. So, I figured it would be easy to search the web to find the original proof.
Shockingly, at least as far as I could find1, it didn&amp;rsquo;t exist on the web! The closest I could find was in Google Books the 1892 volume of the JÃ¤hresbericht Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung (which many of the references pointed to), but in fact not the first value of that journal which contains the actual proof.</description>
