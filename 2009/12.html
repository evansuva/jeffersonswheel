				<small>Thursday, December 3rd, 2009</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><img border=2 src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/12/03/sports/soccer/04draw1/articleInline.jpg" alt="" align="right" />The New York Times has an article about rigging the World Cup draw (which takes place tomorrow in South Africa): <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/sports/soccer/04draw.html"><em>In World Cup Draw, Conspiracy Theories Abound</em></a>, 3 December 2009.</p>
<p>The article mentions the final exam from my 2005 Cryptography course:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is anyone’s guess how the 32 teams in the 2010 World Cup will be grouped by the draw Friday in South Africa, but one thing is for sure: the event will elicit sightings of things as far-fetched as U.F.O.’s and the Virgin Mary’s image on a potato chip.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Yet conspiracy theories abound. In 2005, the issue was part of a final exam in a cryptology course at the University of Virginia.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s the actual exam: <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/cs588/final/final.html"><em>http://www.cs.virginia.edu/cs588/final/final.html</em></a> and an excerpt from my </a><a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/cs588/final/comments.html">comments</a>:</p>
<p><strong>4W</strong>. Germany 1, USA 0</p>
<p>After the 1994 World Cup draw placed the host USA in a very difficult<br />
group, the USA coach, Bora Milutinovic, is reputed to have complained<br />
that the US organizing committee was so incompetent they couldn&#8217;t even<br />
rig the draw properly.  For purposes of this question, assume the DFB<br />
(German soccer federation) which is hosting the 2006 World Cup does not<br />
suffer from such incompetence.</p>
<p>The draw assigns each qualified team to a group (one of eight, A-H) and<br />
position (1-4).  For example, in the 2002 draw the USA was assigned D3.<br />
The host country is placed into position A1.</p>
<p>The protocol for the draw for the 2006 World Cup finals has not been<br />
announced yet, but assume it will follow a protocol similar to this one<br />
which was used in 2002:</p>
<ol> <strong>Before the draw event:</strong></p>
<li> The name of each finalist (except the host country which is placed<br />
in position A1) is printed on a slip of paper which is placed in a<br />
white, spherical ball.  The ball is made of two hemispheres that connect<br />
to each other, and can be separated to insert or remove the paper.  The<br />
balls are placed into different bowls based on a partitioning determined<br />
by FIFA.</li>
<li> The letter name to identify each group (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) is<br />
printed on a slip of paper and placed in a red, spherical ball.  All the<br />
red balls are placed in a bowl.</li>
<li> The position number (1, 2, 3, 4) is printed on a slip of paper and<br />
placed in a blue, spherical ball.  There are eight bowls of the four<br />
numbers, one corresponding to each group A-H.  (In the bowl for A, only<br />
three balls with numbers 2, 3 and 4 are used, since the host country was<br />
preassigned to position A1).</p>
<p><strong>At the draw event:</strong></li>
<li> A well-known celebrity picks a white ball from one of the country<br />
bowls and hands it to Sepp Blatter, the President of FIFA.</li>
<li> Blatter unscrews the ball, extracts the slip of paper, reads the<br />
country name, and holds it up so everyone can see.  After reading the<br />
slip, it is placed in a trash bin that is not examined after the draw.</li>
<li> A different well-known celebrity picks a red ball from the<br />
group bowl and hand it to Blatter.</li>
<li> Blatter unscrews the ball, extracts the slip of paper, reads the<br />
group name, and holds it up so everyone can see.</li>
<li> A different well-known celebrity picks a blue ball from the<br />
positions bowl corresponding to the selected group and hand it to Blatter.</li>
<li> Blatter unscrews the ball, extracts the slip of paper, reads the<br />
position number, and holds it up so everyone can see.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that at the end of the draw, all balls have been opened.  It is a<br />
check on the protocol that all positions, groups and countries have been<br />
seen by the end.  The actual slips of paper are destroyed (without<br />
examination) after the draw.</p>
<p>You should assume both the DFB who is hosting the draw, and Sepp<br />
Blatter, are both highly motivated to rig the results to ensure an easy<br />
path to the second round for the host country.  Well-known celebrities<br />
are used to pick the balls to ensure a low likelihood that a selector<br />
can be corrupted.  The pre-draw steps are done in secret by the DFB.<br />
The draw event itself is witnessed by thousands of people live and in<br />
person and approximately a billion people live on TV around the world<br />
(it is the world&#8217;s most watched televised event that is not a soccer<br />
game).</p>
<p>Analyze the security of the World Cup draw procedure as described<br />
above.  Either describe tactics the DFB could use to improve the<br />
likelihood that Germany get a favorable draw, or argue that the<br />
procedure is secure and there is no reasonable way of effecting the<br />
result.  If you identify security weaknesses in the draw protocol,<br />
suggest modifications that would make it more secure.</p>
<p>For inspiration, you may want to read Bruce Schneier&#8217;s <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/04/hacking_the_pap.html"><em>Hacking the Papal Election</em></a> analysis of the Papal election procedure.</p>
<p><span><br />
(Note: this question should in no way be interpreted as<br />
questioning the integrity of FIFA or the DFB, especially if they are<br />
using RFID tags to track my tickets&#8217; whereabouts.)<br />
</span><br />
<strong>Comments:</strong> <em>There are lots of weaknesses in the described protocol<br />
(which does not match the actual world cup draw protocol which may have even more vulnerabilities) that could be used to alter the draw outcome.</p>
<p>The least risky way of rigging the draw would be to adjust the weights of the balls to increase the likelihood that certain balls end up on the outside edge of the bowl and will be picked early.  This can effect the probabilities of getting certain teams in Germany&#8217;s group, and involves little risk of getting caught (as long as the process of loading the balls is done in secret by trusted (but not trustworthy) people).</p>
<p>A riskier, but more certain, way of fixing the draw would be to put two slips in some of the balls.  Blatter would need to be able to pick the right slip without anyone noticing him doing so.  The easiest way would be to have two slips of different length that are attached with a very weak adhesive.  Blatter knows that the shorter slip has the strong team and the longer slip has the weak team.  There are two balls with two slips, so Blatter will need to remember for the next ball to pick the opposite one.  This allows control of two teams, which is not enough to control the whole draw, but is enough to give Germany one easier team.</p>
<p>Blatter could also have a slip &#8220;up his sleeve&#8221; with a desirable team name on it, but it would be difficult to pull of any sleight of hand tricks without getting caught.</p>
<p>Some improvements that would make cheating more difficult would be to have an independent third party create the balls in public, to have a multiple-readers strategy like in the Pope election where several people examine each slip in public, to have the celebrities (considered uncorruptable) not only pick the ball but open it and examine the slip before it is read, and to have all the balls selected before any one it opened (to prevent any attacks that depend on knowing what was in the previous ball to pick a desirable ball).</em></p>
<p>
From the NYT article, I may be mistaken about the rumors of Bora Milutinovic&#8217;s comments about the 1994 draw.  Perhaps it was really Bruce Arena&#8217;s quote about the draw for the 1996 Olympics, quoted in the NYT article which is presumably a fairly reputable source.</p>
<p>As for tomorrow&#8217;s draw, so long as the US doesn&#8217;t end up in a group with Brazil, France, and Ivory Coast, I&#8217;m willing to assume its not rigged.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, December 2nd, 2009</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>IEEE Spectrum has an article on Karsten Nohl&#8217;s efforts to lead an open-source GSM hacking project: <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/open-source-effort-to-hack-gsm"><em>Open-Source Effort to Hack GSM</em></a>, IEEE Spectrum, 30 November 2009.</p>
<blockquote><p>
If you&#8217;re still using a cellphone based on early digital standards, you better be careful what you say. The encryption technology used to prevent eavesdropping in GSM (Global System for Mobile communications), the world&#8217;s most widely used cellphone system, has more security holes than Swiss cheese, according to an expert who plans to poke a big hole of his own.</p>
<p>
Karsten Nohl, chief research scientist with H4RDW4RE, a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based security research firm, is mounting what could be the most ambitious attempt yet to compromise the GSM phone system, which is used by over 3 billion people around the world. Others have cracked the A5/1 encryption technology used in GSM before, but their results have remained secret. However, Nohl, who earned a Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Virginia and is a member of Germany&#8217;s Chaos Computer Club (CCC), intends to go one big step further: By the end of the year, he plans to make the keys available to everyone on the Internet.</p>
<p>
&#8230;</p>
<p>
GSM cracking has a long history, which began in the late 1990s in academic circles and has since sprouted a handful of commercial businesses. Today, these companies legally sell GSM call-interception solutions&#8211;which are relatively expensive&#8211;mostly to government intelligence agencies. In general, supplying and using this software is illegal in the wider market, but no one can say for certain how many groups have illegally gained access to the technology.</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s the point Nohl hopes to drive home: The A5/1 algorithm is a broken 64-bit encryption technology, a relic of the Cold War era, when laws prohibited the export of strong encryption technology from the United States. It needs to be replaced&#8211;ideally by the much stronger, 128-bit A5/3 system, which is already being used in newer-generation digital cellular systems, such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). &#8220;If you go from the 64 bits of the A5/1 cipher to the 128 bits of A5/3,&#8221; says Nohl, cracking requires an amount of memory storage that is beyond what &#8220;is available on earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>
A big problem with plugging the GSM encryption hole, according to the security expert, is that operators are unwilling to admit that a problem even exists. Many want to avoid spending additional money on upgrading aging and amortized GSM infrastructure, he says. The GSM Association, which represents the interests of GSM mobile operators around the world, says only that it is aware of various eavesdropping projects. In the same breath, it points to the complexities of identifying and recording calls from RF signals.
