				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times has an article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/12/technology/kids-apps-data-privacy-google-twitter.html"><em>How Game Apps That Captivate Kids Have Been Collecting Their Data</em></a> about a lawsuit the state of New Mexico is bringing against app markets (including Google) that allow apps presented as being for children in the Play store to violate COPPA rules and mislead users into tracking children. The lawsuit stems from a study led by Serge Egleman’s group at UC Berkeley that analyzed COPPA violations in children’s apps. Serge was an undergraduate student here (back in the early 2000s) &#8211; one of the things he did as a undergraduate was successfully sue a spammer.</p>
<p>The original paper about the study: <a href="https://blues.cs.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/popets-2018-0021.pdf">“Won’t Somebody Think of the Children?” Examining COPPA Compliance at Scale</a>, Irwin Reyes, Primal Wijesekera, Joel Reardon, Amit Elazari Bar On, Abbas Razaghpanah, Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, and Serge Egelman. Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETS) 2018.</p>

Serge Egelman, a researcher with the International Computer Science Institute and the University of California, Berkeley, helped lead the study of nearly 6,000 children’s Android apps<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muzzammil Zaveri (BACS 2011) has been recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of the top 30 venture capitalists under 30. As an undergraduate researcher, Muzzammil worked on <a href="https://github.com/guardrails/guardrails">Guardrails</a> (secure web application framework).</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/muzzammil-mz-zaveri/?list=30under30-venture-capital">Forbes Recognition</a>
</p>
<p>
UVa Today Article: <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/meet-5-alumni-forbes-new-30-under-30-lists"><em>Meet the 5 Alumni on Forbes’ new ‘30 under 30’ Lists</em></a>, 15 November 2017.
</p>
<p>
Cavalier Daily Article: <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2017/12/forbes-30-under-30-recognizes-five-u-va-alumni"><em>Forbes 30 under 30 recognizes five U.Va alumni</em></a>, 4 December 2017.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Zaveri stressed the importance of pursuing passion and making positive use of free time while studying as an undergraduate.
</p>
<p>
“There’s nothing like being in a setting where you can make mistakes and explore interests,” he said. “Doing something that you’re strictly passionate about may not be the most productive — you can explore interests and area that you might be passionate about and that can be a great springboard into your own career, or whatever you decide to pursue in life after school.”
</p>
<p>
Zaveri believes he was very lucky with the connections he made at the University, especially with meeting his co-founder, Ethan Fast. He credits Evans, his advisor with empowering him with knowledge and encouraging him to learn more about tech startups.
</p>
<p>
“[Evans] really encouraged and spent time diving into startups and exploring some of my interests in building side projects,” he said. “And through that I met my co-founder [Ethan Fast] and ultimately, we ended up starting Proxino together.”

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adrienne Porter Felt (SRG BSCS 2008) was selected as one of Technology Review&#8217;s <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/innovators-under-35/2017/visionary/adrienne-felt/">35 Innovators Under 35</a>.</p>
<p>UVA Today has an article:<a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/alumna-turned-internet-security-expert-listed-among-nations-top-young-innovators-0"><em>Alumna-Turned-Internet Security Expert Listed Among Nation’s Top Young Innovators</em></a>, UVA Today, 21 September 2017.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Felt started working in security when she was a second-year engineering student, responding to a request from computer science professor David Evans, who taught the “Program and Data Representation” course. Evans said Felt stood out amongst her peers because of her “well-thought-out answers and meticulous diagrams.”</p>
<p>“For the summer after her second year, she joined a project one of my Ph.D. students was working on to use the disk drive controller to detect malware based on the reads and writes it makes that are visible to the disk,” Evans said. “She did great work on that project, and by the end of the summer was envisioning her own research ideas.</p>
<p>“She came up with the idea of looking at privacy issues in Facebook applications, which, back in 2007, was just emerging, and no one else was yet looking into privacy issues like this.”</p>
<p>Taking Evans’ offer for a research project was a turning point in Felt’s life, showing her something she liked that she could do well.</p>
<p>“It turned out that I really loved it,” she said. “I like working in privacy and security because I enjoy helping people control their digital experiences. I think of it as, ‘I’m professionally paranoid, so that other people don’t need to be.’”</p>
<p>In her final semester as an undergraduate student at UVA, Felt taught a student-led class on web browsers.</p>
<p>“Her work at Google has dramatically changed the way web browsers convey security information to users, making the web safer for everyone,” Evans said. “Her team at Google has been studying deployment of HTTPS, the protocol that allows web clients to securely communicate with servers, and has had fantastic success in improving security of websites worldwide, as well as a carefully designed plan to use browser interfaces to further encourage adoption of secure web protocols.

<p>For the Symposium, I presented a tutorial <a href="http://ssist2016.shanghaitech.edu.cn/speakers.html#evans">introduction to secure multi-party computation</a> (focused towards systems researchers), and an invited talk on <em>Memory for Data-Oblivious Computation</em>.  Was a special honor to be able to speak about MPC applications build using Yao&#8217;s protocol following Andrew Yao&#8217;s opening keynote.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karsten Nohl (SRG CpE PhD 2009) was on CBS&#8217; 60 Minutes (April 17) as their &#8220;Moment of the Week&#8221;: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-hacking-your-phone/"><em>Hacking into a congressman&#8217;s phone</em></a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em><br />
We heard we could find some of the world&#8217;s best hackers in Germany. So we headed for Berlin. Just off a trendy street and through this alley we rang the bell at the door of a former factory. That&#8217;s where we met Karsten Nohl, a German hacker, with a doctorate in computer engineering from the University of Virginia.<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/04/17/98a3a290-5a85-448d-931f-16d663e5f48e/thumbnail/770x430/529616bb49f71e495bef131c8e630946/hackingyourphone.jpg" alt="hackingyourphone.jpg" height="430" width="770"></p>
<p>
Karsten demonstrated to the reporter how to track a Congressman&#8217;s location and listen in on phone conversations using <A href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/12/18/german-researchers-discover-a-flaw-that-could-let-anyone-listen-to-your-cell-calls-and-read-your-texts/">SS7 vulnerabilities</a> (for a real Congressman, Ted Liu of California, who actually has a CS degree). With permission, of course!
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>We wanted to see whether Nohl&#8217;s group could actually do what they claimed &#8212; so we sent an off-the-shelf iPhone from 60 Minutes in New York to Representative Ted Lieu, a congressman from California. He has a computer science degree from Stanford and is a member of the House committee that oversees information technology. He agreed to use our phone to talk to his staff knowing they would be hacked and they were. All we gave Nohl, was the number of the 60 Minutes iPhone that we lent the congressman.</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>An excerpt from the show was also the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/hacking-into-a-congressmans-phone/"><em>60 Minutes Moment of the Week</em></a>.</p>
