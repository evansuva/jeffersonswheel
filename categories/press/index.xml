&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;excerpt&#34;&gt;

Although researchers such as David Evans of the University of Virginia see a full explanation being a little way off in the future, the massive number of parameters encoded by DNNs and the avoidance of overtraining due to SGD may have an answer to why the networks can hallucinate images and, as a result, see things that are not there and ignore those that are.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;
He points to work by PhD student Mainuddin Jonas that shows how adversarial examples can push the output away from what we would see as the correct answer. &amp;#8220;It could be just one layer [that makes the mistake]. But from our experience it seems more gradual. It seems many of the layers are being exploited, each one just a little bit. The biggest differences may not be apparent until the very last layer.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;
Researchers such as Evans predict a lengthy arms race in attacks and countermeasures that may on the way reveal a lot more about the nature of machine learning and its relationship with reality.

      <title>Violations of Children’s Privacy Laws</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The New York Times has an article, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/12/technology/kids-apps-data-privacy-google-twitter.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Game Apps That Captivate Kids Have Been Collecting Their Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about a lawsuit the state of New Mexico is bringing against app markets (including Google) that allow apps presented as being for children in the Play store to violate COPPA rules and mislead users into tracking children. The lawsuit stems from a study led by Serge Egleman’s group at UC Berkeley that analyzed COPPA violations in children’s apps. Serge was an undergraduate student here (back in the early 2000s) &amp;#8211; one of the things he did as a undergraduate was successfully sue a spammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original paper about the study: &lt;a href=&#34;https://blues.cs.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/popets-2018-0021.pdf&#34;&gt;“Won’t Somebody Think of the Children?” Examining COPPA Compliance at Scale&lt;/a&gt;, Irwin Reyes, Primal Wijesekera, Joel Reardon, Amit Elazari Bar On, Abbas Razaghpanah, Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, and Serge Egelman.

Serge Egelman, a researcher with the International Computer Science Institute and the University of California, Berkeley, helped lead the study of nearly 6,000 children’s Android apps&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Cybersecurity Summer Camp</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I helped organize a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ahmed.ai/cyberwars2018&#34;&gt;summer camp for high school teachers focused on cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;, led by Ahmed Ibrahim.  Some of the materials from the camp on cryptography, including the Jefferson Wheel and visual cryptography are here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/evansuva/cipherschool&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cipher School for Muggles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Earlier this week, 25 high school teachers – including 21 from Virginia – filled a glass-walled room in Rice Hall, sitting in high adjustable chairs at wheeled work tables, their laptops open, following a lecture with graphics about the dangers that lurk in cyberspace and trying to figure out how to pass the information on to a generation that seems to share the most intimate details of life online. &amp;#8220;I think understanding privacy is important to that generation that uses Facebook and Snapchat,&amp;#8221; said David Evans, a computer science professor who helped organize the camp. &amp;#8220;We hope to give teachers some ideas and tools to get their students excited about learning about cryptography, privacy and cybersecurity, and how these things can impact them.&amp;#8221;
