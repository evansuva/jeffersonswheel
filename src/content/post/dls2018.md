I gave a keynote talk at the <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2018/DLS/#"><em>1st Deep Learning and Security Workshop</em></a> (co-located with the 39th <em>IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy</em>). San Francisco, California. 24 May 2018</p>

<b>Abstract</b><br />
</center></p>
<p>
Over the past few years, there has been an explosion of research in security of machine learning and on adversarial examples in particular. Although this is in many ways a new and immature research area, the general problem of adversarial examples has been a core problem in information security for thousands of years. In this talk, I&#8217;ll look at some of the long-forgotten lessons from that quest and attempt to understand what, if anything, has changed now we are in the era of deep learning classifiers. I will survey the prevailing definitions for &#8220;adversarial examples&#8221;, argue that those definitions are unlikely to be the right ones, and raise questions about whether those definitions are leading us astray.</p>
