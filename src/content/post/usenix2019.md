Also, great to see several UVA folks at the conference including:

- [Sam Havron](https://havron.dev) (BSCS 2017, now a PhD student at
  Cornell) presented a paper on the work he and his colleagues have
  done on [computer security for victims of intimate partner violence](https://havron.dev/pubs/clinicalsec.pdf).

- [Serge Egelman](https://www.guanotronic.com/~serge/) (BSCS 2004) was an author on the paper [_50 Ways to Leak Your Data: An
Exploration of Apps' Circumvention of the Android Permissions
System_](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/reardon)
(which was recognized by a Distinguished Paper Award). His paper in
SOUPS on [_Privacy and Security Threat Models and Mitigation
Strategies of Older
Adults_](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/soups2019-frik.pdf) was highlighted in Alex Stamos' excellent talk.

- [Yuan Tian](https://www.ytian.info/) (UVA professor) presented her work on Chinese password guessability (since the student author who was planning to present was unfortunately unable to obtain a visa in time). Chinese passwords are different from those of English speakers in many interesting ways, but everyone agrees that `123456` is a great password.
