Xiao Zhang and Saeed Mahloujifar will present our work on _Empirically Measuring Concentration: Fundamental Limits on Intrinsic Robustness_ at two workshops May 6 at ICLR 2019 in New Orleans: [_Debugging Machine Learning Models_](https://debug-ml-iclr2019.github.io/) and [_Safe Machine Learning:
Specification, Robustness and Assurance_](https://sites.google.com/view/safeml-iclr2019).
