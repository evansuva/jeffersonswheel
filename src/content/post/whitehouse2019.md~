I had a chance to visit the White House for a Roundtable on
_Accelerating Responsible Sharing of Federal Data_. The meeting was
held under "Chatham House Rules", so I won't mention the other
participants here.

The meeting was held in the [Roosevelt
Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_Room) of the White
House. We entered through the visitor's side entrance. After a
security gate (where you put your phone in a lockbox, so no pictures
inside) with a TV blaring Fox News, there is a pleasant lobby for
waiting, and then an entrance right into the Roosevelt Room. (We
didn't get to see the entrance in the opposite corner of the room,
which is just a hallway across from the Oval Office.)

After the meeting, as a sign of the national state at the time,
participants were given a gift &mdash; a box of red, white, and blue M
&amp; M's with a barely legible signature on them. I wasn't brave
enough to eat the contents myself, but according to my kids, they were
not as good as Smarties or Reese's Pieces.




Participants were invited to provide written statements before and
after the meeting. Mine are here:
