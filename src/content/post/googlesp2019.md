I presented a short talk at a workshop at Google on <em>Adversarial ML: Closing Gaps between Theory and Practice</em> (mostly fun for the [movie of me trying to solve Google's CAPTCHA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVmjjfTvnFs) on the last slide):

Getting the actual screencast to fit into the limited time for this talk challenged the limits of my video editing skills.
