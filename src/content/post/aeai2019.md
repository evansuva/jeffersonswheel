I was honored to particilate in a panel at an event on 
[_Adult Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence_](https://aohdc.org/adulteducationandai/) that was run by [The Great Courses](https://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/) as a fundraiser for the [Academy of Hope](https://aohdc.org/), an adult public charter school in Washington, D.C.

My talk was the first for the panel, followed by talks by Nicole Smith
and Ellen Scully-Russ, and a keynote from Dexter Manley, Super Bowl
winner with the Washington Redskins. Following the talks, Kavitha
Cardoza moderated a very interesting panel discussion.

My talk was on _Jobs for Human Beings, 2029-2059_. For the actual
talk, I was able to use beautiful images from Getty Images which The
Great Courses has a license to (and not allowed to use Create Commons
images, since they do not count as non-commercial), so I've replaced
the images from the talk with CC-licensed images. (The recording of
the talk and rest of the event will be available to Great Courses Plus
subscribers, with the parts where I needed to use CC-licensed images
to explain machine learning blurred out of the recording.)
