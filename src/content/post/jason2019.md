I had the privilege of speaking at the JASON Spring Meeting,
undoubtably one of the most diverse meetings I've been part of with
talks on hypersonic signatures (from my DSSG 2008-2009 colleague, Ian
Boyd), FBI DNA, nuclear proliferation in Iran, engineering biological
materials, and the 2020 census (including a very interesting
presentatino from John Abowd on the differential privacy mechanisms
they have developed and evaluated). (Unfortunately, my lack of
security clearance kept me out of the SCIF used for the talks on
quantum computing and more sensitive topics).
