My course for Spring 2019 is [_Markets, Mechanisms,
Machines_](https://uvammm.github.io/), cross-listed as cs4501/econ4559
and co-taught with [Denis
Nekipelov](http://people.virginia.edu/~dn4w/). The course will explore
interesting connections between economics and computer science.

My qualifications for being listed as instructor for a 4000-level
Economics course are limited to taking an introductory microeconomics
course my first year as an undergraduate.

Its good to finally get a chance to redeem myself for giving up on
Economics 28 years ago!
