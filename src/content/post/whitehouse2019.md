I had a chance to visit the White House for a Roundtable on
_Accelerating Responsible Sharing of Federal Data_. The meeting was
held under "Chatham House Rules", so I won't mention the other
participants here.

The meeting was held in the [Roosevelt
Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_Room) of the White
House. We entered through the visitor's side entrance. After a
security gate (where you put your phone in a lockbox, so no pictures
inside) with a TV blaring Fox News, there is a pleasant lobby for
waiting, and then an entrance right into the Roosevelt Room. (We
didn't get to see the entrance in the opposite corner of the room,
which is just a hallway across from the Oval Office.)

After the meeting, as a sign of the national state at the time,
participants were given a gift &mdash; a box of red, white, and blue M	
&amp; M's with a barely legible signature on them. I wasn't brave
enough to eat the contents myself, but according to my kids, they were
not as good as Smarties or Reese's Pieces.
