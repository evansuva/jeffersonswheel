I helped organize a <a href="https://www.ahmed.ai/cyberwars2018">summer camp for high school teachers focused on cybersecurity</a>, led by Ahmed Ibrahim.  Some of the materials from the camp on cryptography, including the Jefferson Wheel and visual cryptography are here: <a href="https://github.com/evansuva/cipherschool"><em>Cipher School for Muggles</em></a>.

<blockquote><p>
Earlier this week, 25 high school teachers – including 21 from Virginia – filled a glass-walled room in Rice Hall, sitting in high adjustable chairs at wheeled work tables, their laptops open, following a lecture with graphics about the dangers that lurk in cyberspace and trying to figure out how to pass the information on to a generation that seems to share the most intimate details of life online. &#8220;I think understanding privacy is important to that generation that uses Facebook and Snapchat,&#8221; said David Evans, a computer science professor who helped organize the camp. &#8220;We hope to give teachers some ideas and tools to get their students excited about learning about cryptography, privacy and cybersecurity, and how these things can impact them.&#8221;
