        <h2 id="finding-black-box-adversarial-examples-with-limited-queries">Finding Black-box Adversarial Examples with Limited Queries</h2>
<p>Black-box attacks generate adversarial examples (AEs) against deep
neural networks with only API access to the victim model.</p>
<p>Existing black-box attacks can be grouped into two main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transfer Attacks</strong> use white-box attacks on local models to find
candidate adversarial examples that transfer to the target model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimization Attacks</strong> use queries to the target model and apply
optimization techniques to search for adversarial examples.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hybrid-attack">Hybrid Attack</h3>
<p>We propose a <em>hybrid attack</em> that combines transfer and optimization attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Transfer Attack → Optimization Attack — take candidate adversarial examples of the local models of transfer attacks as the starting points for optimization attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimization Attack → Transfer Attack — intermediate query results from the optimization attacks are used to fine-tune the local models of transfer attacks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<center>
<a href="/images/usenix2020/hybridattack.png"><img src="/images/usenix2020/hybridattack.png" width="60%" align="center"></a>
</center>
<p>We validate effectiveness of the hybrid attack over the baseline on three benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet. In this post, we only show the results of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11770">AutoZOOM</a> as the selected optimization method. More results of other attacks can be found in the <a href="../docs/hybrid_attack.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
<h2 id="local-adversarial-examples-are-useful-transfer-rarr-optimization">Local Adversarial Examples are Useful (Transfer → Optimization)</h2>
<p>Below, we compare the performance of AutoZOOM attack when it starts
from 1) the local adversarial examples, and 2) the original
points. Here, we report results for targeted attacks on normal (i.e.,
non-robust) models:</p>
<center><a href="/images/usenix2020/local_candidate_results.png"><img src="/images/usenix2020/local_candidate_results.png" width="65%" align="center"></a></center>
<p>Local AEs can substantially boost the performance of optimization
attacks, but when the same attack is used against <a href="https://github.com/MadryLab/cifar10_challenge">robust
models</a>, the improvement is small:</p>
<center><a href="<img src="/images/usenix2020/normal_model_fails.png"><img src="/images/usenix2020/normal_model_fails.png" width="65%" align="center"></a></center>
<p>This ineffectiveness appears to stem from differences in the attack
space of normal and robust models. Therefore, to improve effectiveness
against robust target model, we use robust local models to produce the
transfer candidates for starting the optimization attacks. The figure
below compares impact of normal and robust local models when attacking
the robust target model:</p>
<center><a href="/images/usenix2020/local_model_comparison.png"><img src="/images/usenix2020/local_model_comparison.png" width="60%" align="center"></a></center>
<h2 id="tuning-with-byproduces-doesnt-help-much-optimization-rarr-transfer">Tuning with Byproduces Doesn&rsquo;t Help Much (Optimization → Transfer)</h2>
<p>Below, we compare the performance of AutoZOOM attack on MNIST normal
model when the local models are 1) fine-tuned during the attack
process, and 2) kept static:</p>
<center><a href="/images/usenix2020/fine_tune_results.png"><img src="/images/usenix2020/fine_tune_results.png" width="60%" align="center"></a></center>
<p>Tuining local models using byproducts from the optimization attack
improves the query efficiency. However, for more complex datasets
(e.g., CIFAR10), we observe degradation in the attack performance by
fine-tuning (check Table 6 in the <a href="../docs/hybrid_attack.pdf">paper</a>).</p>
<h2 id="batch-attacks">Batch Attacks</h2>
<p>We consider a <strong>batch attack</strong> scenario: adversaries have limited
number of queries and want to maximize the number of adversarial
examples found within the limit. This is a more realistic way to
evaluate attacks for most adversarial purposes, then just looking at
the average cost to attack each seed in a large pool of seeds.</p>
<p>The number of queries required for attacking a specific seed varies
greatly across seeds:</p>
<center><a href="/images/usenix2020/query_variance.png"><img src="../images/usenix2020/query_variance.png" width="80%" align="center"></a></center>
<p>Based on this observation, we propose <strong>two-phase strategy</strong> to prioritize easy seeds for the <strong>hybrid attack</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the first phase, the likely-to-transfer seeds are prioritized
based on their PGD-steps taken to attack the local models. The
candidate adversarial example for seed seed is attempted in order to
find all the direct transfers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second phase, the remaining seeds are prioritized based on
their target loss value with respect to the target model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To validate effectievness of the two-phase strategy, we compare to two seed prioritization strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Retroactive Optimal</strong>: a non-realizable attack that assumes adversaries already know the exact number of queries to attack each seed (before the attack starts) and can prioritize seeds by their actual query cost. This provides an lower bound on the query cost for an optimal strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Random:</strong> this is a baseline strategy where seeds are prioritized in random order (this is the stragety assumed in most works where the adverage costs are reported).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Results for the AutoZOOM attack on a normal ImageNet model are shown below:</p>
<center><img src="../images/usenix2020/batch_attack_results.png" width="60%" align="center"></center>
<p>Our two-phase strategy performs closely to the retroactive optimal
strategy and outpeforms random baseline significantly: with same
number of query limit, two-phase strategy finds significantly more
adversarial examples comapred to the random baseline, and is closer to
the retroactive optimal case. (See the paper for more experimental
results and variations on the prioritization strategy.)</p>
<h3 id="main-takeaways">Main Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transfer → Optimization:</strong> local adversarial examples can generally be used to boost optimization attacks. One caveat is, against robust target model, hybrid attack is more effective with robust local models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transfer → Optimization:</strong> fine-tuning local models is only helpful for small scale dataset (e.g., MNIST) and fails to generalize to more complex datasets. It is an open question whether we can make the fine-tuning process work for complex datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritizing seeds</strong> based on two-phase strategy for the hybrid attack can significantly improve its query efficiency in batch attack scenario.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our results make the case that it is important to evaluate both
attacks and defenses with a more realistic adversary model than just
looking at the average cost to attack a seed over a large pool of
seeds. When an adversary only need to find a small number of
adversarial examples, and has access to a large pool of potential
seeds to attack (of equal value to the adversary), then the effective
costs of a successful attack can be orders of magnitude lower than
what would be projected assuming an adversary who cannot prioritize
seeds to attack.</p>

present our work (with <a
href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sm5fd/">Saeed Mahloujifar</a> and
<a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~mohammad/">Mohamood

2019</a>,
Vancouver, 10 December 2019.</p>
<p>Recent theoretical results, starting with Gilmer et al.&lsquo;s
<a href="https://aipavilion.github.io/"><em>Adversarial Spheres</em></a> (2018), show
that if inputs are drawn from a concentrated metric probability space,
then adversarial examples with small perturbation are inevitable.c The
key insight from this line of research is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_measure%22%3E"><em>concentration of
measure</em></a>
gives lower bound on adversarial risk for a large collection of
classifiers (e.g. imperfect classifiers with risk at least $\alpha$),
which further implies the impossibility results for robust learning
against adversarial examples.</p>
<center><img src="/images/concentration/advRisk.png" width="80%" align="center"></center>
<p>However, it is not clear whether these theoretical results apply to
actual distributions such as images. This work presents a method for
empirically measuring and bounding the concentration of a concrete
dataset which is proven to converge to the actual concentration. More
specifically, we prove that by simultaneously increasing the sample
size and a complexity parameter of the selected collection of subsets
$\mathcal{G}$, the concentration of the empirical measure based on
samples converges to the actual concentration asymptotically.</p>
<center><img src="/images/concentration/theory.png" width="70%" align="center"></center>
<p>To solve the empirical concentration problem, we propose heuristic
algorithms to find error regions with small expansion under both
$\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ metrics.</p>
<p>For instance, our algorithm for $\ell_\infty$ starts by sorting the
dataset based on the empirical density estimated using k-nearest
neighbor, and then obtains $T$ rectangular data clusters by performing
k-means clustering on the top-$q$ densest images. After expanding each
of the rectangles by $\epsilon$, the error region $\mathcal{E}$ is
then specified as the complement of the expanded rectangles (the
reddish region in the following figure). Finally, we search for the
best error region by tuning the number of rectangles $T$ and the
initial coverage percentile $q$.</p>
<p><img src="/images/concentration/alg.png" width="80%" align="center"></center></p>
<p>Based on the proposed algorithm, we empirically measure the
concentration for image benchmarks, such as MNIST and
CIFAR-10. Compared with state-of-the-art robustly trained models, our
estimated bound shows that, for most settings, there exists a large
gap between the robust error achieved by the best current models and
the theoretical limits implied by concentration.</p>
<p><img src="/images/concentration/experiments.png" width="100%" align="center"><br></center></p>
<p>This suggests the concentration of measure is not the only reason
behind the vulnerability of existing classifiers to adversarial
perturbations. Thus, either there is room for improving the robustness
of image classifiers or a need for deeper understanding of the reasons
for the gap between intrinsic robustness and the actual robustness
achieved by robust models.</p>

Another example is automated teller machine. ATMs automated many of
the roles previously done by human bank tellers.
</p><p>
ATM Machines didn’t eliminate jobs for bank tellers – actually made
more, since they make banking cheaper and more accessible, and meant
banks could open more branches which still needed to hire tellers for
the more interesting and complicated banking activities.
</p><p>
We’ve seen many transformations like this, and many tasks that could
once only be done by humans are now routinely automated. Although past
technological advances have caused massive disruption and pain for
many individuals, as a species on the whole, these advances have not
diminished overall human employment, and there shouldn’t be any doubt
that on the whole, technological and scientific program have made all

One way to measure that progress is what fraction of our workforce is needed to feed us. 
</p>
<p>
As recently as 150 years ago, nearly everyone worked in agriculture, and we still couldn’t produce enough food to feed everyone. Now, only about 1 out of 75 people work in farming, and we are so ridiculously productive in producing food with we can burn about 1/3 of it as fuel.
</p>
<p>
So, if we were driven as a species to avoid work once our subsistence needs are met, we shouldn’t be working 8 hours or more a day.

Somehow we’ve managed improve productivity by a factor of several hundred, without reducing the demand for human work. All the previous scientific and technological progress that has automated work has just led to finding new productive things for humans to do.

## _Will Artificial Intelligence Change Everything?_
</center>
<p>The question for today is if we are reaching the end of that – are the
kinds of automation that can be achieved (or soon will be) with
artificial intelligence that they won’t just improve productivity by
automating some human tasks, but that they will eliminate the
opportunity for humans to contribute productively at all.</p>
</p>
<p>
First, its important to distinguish AI from the traditional automation
that has driven productivity gains for the past hundred years.

<p>We’ve only experienced the disruption computing causes over the past
half century, but a few people had the vision of what was possible
much longer ago.</p>
</p>
<p>
The first person to see the potential for universal
computers, was Gottfried Leibniz back in the 17th century. 
</p>
<div class="quote">
<em>The human race will have a new kind of instrument which will increase the power of the mind much more than optical lenses strengthen the eyes and which will be as far superior to microscopes or telescopes as reason is superior to sight.</em><br>
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1679)
</div>
<p>
Leibniz is talking about increasing the power of our minds the way a telescope
increases the power of our eyes.  This is what traditional
computing has done. 
</p>
<p> 
More recently, Steve Jobs talked about computers as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=Pm_WAWZNbdA&feature=emb_logo">bicycles for the mind</a>.

We have machines now that can do any computation we understand well enough to describe in simple steps quadrillions of times faster than humans can do it. We can also build computing systems, like the one most of us have in our pockets, that don’t just do one one human understands faster, but that can take the collective efforts of millions of humans over decades to make it possible for us to play “Angry Birds”.

<p>
All of the previous capabilities can only solve problems humans already understand well enough to solve.
</p>
<p>
AI allows us to solve problems no humans understand.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to focus now on Machine Learning, which is just one sub-field of AI, but it’s the one that has the most hype over the past decade, and one that is being rapidly deployed in ways that automate human tasks.
</p>
<p>
The main distinction between traditional computing and machine learning is that traditional automatons are programmed, while machine learning automatons are trained. Humans set up a training process, but the machine learns how to solve the problem on its own.

I’ll illustrate with a simple example – building a machine to distinguish women and men in pictures.

This is something most humans are quite good at, but if I asked you how you do it, you couldn’t explain it. And, since humans can’t explain how to do it, we don’t know how to write a program to do it, but we can train a model that does it well.

First, we need to collect training images.
</p>
<p>
<p>Training complex models requires a lot of training data – a few
million images. Fortunately, you can find billions of images on the

Next, we need to label the images. This is what is called <em>“supervised learning”</em> – we are telling the machine the correct answers, and it is training to find a model that matches those answers.
</p>
<p>
Labeling 10M images might seem like a lot of work, but you can <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/pdf/ImageNet_CVPR2009.pdf">find low-paid humans to do it</a>.

Now, we’re ready to train a model. But first, we need to decide on a model architecture.

This just means designing a function with lots of unknown parameters that takes all the pixels of an images as its inputs, and outputs a prediction of gender and confidence.

We train the model by starting with random values for all those parameters, testing the labeled images, and updating the weights until we get a model that makes good predictions.

The problem is the learning process is just about learning statistical patterns in data – the model is not developing any real understanding of men and women. 
</p><p>
Since most of the people in the labeled data who were holding umbrellas were women, the model learned a strong pattern that if you are holding an umbrella you must be a woman.
</p><p>
Being mis-gendered because of holding an umbrella may not be such a serious problem, but the same kinds of learning methods are used in many more sensitive tasks, like predicting who is a terrorist and who gets a job interview.

The hard thing about making predictions, is that our brains and the
experiences we relate to are linear – we get one year older every
year, and can relate to linear change easily.

People tend to talk about exponential change as though it is rare
and special, but it is actually the way nearly everything that matters
changes.

All it means to be <em>exponential</em>, is that the change is a
percentage of the current value, like increasing by 5% a year or
doubling every decade.

Predicting exponential growth is the easiest and safest prediction
to make. The only way it goes wrong is if there is some physical limit
that stops the growth – Malthus thought we were at the limit of how
much an acre of land could produce in 1800 – but you can see from the
graph on the right that we weren’t, and this is one of the reasons he
got things so wrong.  </p>

you were at risk of making really bad predictions.

A 3-minute call from NY to Chicago cost \$5.45 in 1903 dollars. <p class="aside">I couldn’t find out if you could call from Washington to California, and adjusting for inflation is tough, but somewhere around a few $1000 seems reasonable.</p>

One way to think about the jobs of the future is to predict when the
cost of automating the job will drop below the cost of hiring a human
to do it today.

Nearly all individual jobs could be automated today, if you invested
enough in a special-purpose solution and in training the machine to do
that specific job.

## Jobs that Won't be Replaced by AI
</center>
<p>
It is hard to predict _when_ particular jobs will be automated out of
existence, but it seems eventually most jobs people have today will
be.
</p>
<p>
I think there are three types of jobs that won’t be – the first two
will be a bit depressing, but don’t give up hope for a hopeful
conclusion until I get to the third one.

Its cheaper to get
humans to do this work since it is physically complex, varied, and
high skill, but the skills required to do it are readily available and
not highly valued by the marketplace, so humans with such skills can
be hired at low cost and easily replaced when necessary. It'll be a

## Hopeful Conclusion
</center>
<p>
In the future, we should <em>all</em> have jobs like these!
</p>
<p>
Everyone should have a job that values their intrinsic humanity, and
technology will soon advance to the point where we all can. In many
ways (recall the diminishing percentage of our workforce employed in
agriculture from earlier) we already have. We just have
to face the challenge of restructuring society to make this work.
