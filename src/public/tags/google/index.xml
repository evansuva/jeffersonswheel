      <description>I presented a short talk at a workshop at Google on Adversarial ML: Closing Gaps between Theory and Practice (mostly fun for the movie of me trying to solve Google&amp;rsquo;s CAPTCHA on the last slide):
 Getting the actual screencast to fit into the limited time for this talk challenged the limits of my video editing skills.
 I can say with some confidence, Google does donuts much better than they do cookies!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back from a very interesting Workshop on Federated Learning and Analytics that was organized by Peter Kairouz and Brendan McMahan from Google&amp;rsquo;s federated learning team and was held at Google Seattle.
For the first part of my talk, I covered Bargav&amp;rsquo;s work on evaluating differentially private machine learning, but I reserved the last few minutes of my talk to address the cognitive dissonance I felt being at a Google meeting on privacy.</description>
