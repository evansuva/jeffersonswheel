      <description>I had a chance to visit the White House for a Roundtable on Accelerating Responsible Sharing of Federal Data. The meeting was held under &amp;ldquo;Chatham House Rules&amp;rdquo;, so I won&amp;rsquo;t mention the other participants here.
   The meeting was held in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. We entered through the visitor&amp;rsquo;s side entrance. After a security gate (where you put your phone in a lockbox, so no pictures inside) with a TV blaring Fox News, there is a pleasant lobby for waiting, and then an entrance right into the Roosevelt Room.</description>
