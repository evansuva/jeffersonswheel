      <description>&lt;p&gt;Samin Yasar presented our paper on &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09802&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Context-award Monitoring in
Robotic Surgery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the 2019
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20190416013641/http://www.ismr.gatech.edu/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Symposium on Medical
Robotics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(ISMR) in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has enabled
procedures with increased precision and dexterity, but surgical robots
are still open loop and require surgeons to work with a tele-operation
console providing only limited visual feedback. In this setting,
mechanical failures, software faults, or human errors might lead to
adverse events resulting in patient complications or fatalities. We
argue that impending adverse events could be detected and mitigated by
applying context-specific safety constraints on the motions of the
robot. We present a context-aware safety monitoring system which
segments a surgical task into subtasks using kinematics data and
monitors safety constraints specific to each subtask. To test our
hypothesis about context specificity of safety constraints, we analyze
recorded demonstrations of dry-lab surgical tasks collected from the
JIGSAWS database as well as from experiments we conducted on a Raven
II surgical robot. Analysis of the trajectory data shows that each
subtask of a given surgical procedure has consistent safety
constraints across multiple demonstrations by different subjects. Our
preliminary results show that violations of these safety constraints
lead to unsafe events, and there is often sufficient time between the
constraint violation and the safety-critical event to allow for a
corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;
