				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bleeping Computer has an article about our work on a more secure password manager: <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/horcrux-is-a-password-manager-designed-for-security-and-paranoid-users/"><em>Horcrux Is a Password Manager Designed for Security and Paranoid Users</em></a>, 4 July 2017.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em><br />
Two researchers from the University of Virginia have developed a new password manager prototype that works quite differently from existing password manager clients.</p>
<p>The research team describes their password manager — which they named Horcrux — as &#8220;a password manager for paranoids,&#8221; due to its security and privacy-focused features and a unique design used for handling user passwords, both while in transit and at rest.</p>
<p>There are two main differences between Horcrux and currently available password manager clients.</p>
<p>The first is how Horcrux inserts user credentials inside web pages. Regular password managers do this by filling in the login form with the user&#8217;s data.<br />
&#8230;<br />
The second feature that makes Horcrux stand out compared to other password manager clients is how it stores user credentials.</p>
<p>Compared to classic solutions, Horcrux doesn&#8217;t trust one single password store but spreads user credentials across multiple servers. This means that if an attacker manages to gain access to one of the servers, he won&#8217;t gain access to all of the user&#8217;s passwords, limiting the damage of any security incident.<br />
&#8230;<br />
More details about the Horcrux design and implementation are available in the research team&#8217;s paper, entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05085.pdf">&#8220;Horcrux: A Password Manager for Paranoids&#8221;</a>.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PCWord has a story about CNBC&#8217;s attempt to &#8220;help&#8221; people measure their password security: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3049552/security/cnbc-just-collected-your-password-and-shared-it-with-marketers.html"><em>CNBC just collected your password and shared it with marketers: An exercise in password security went terribly wrong, security experts say</em></a>, 29 March 2016.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Adrienne Porter Felt, a software engineer with Google&#8217;s Chrome security team, spotted that the article wasn&#8217;t delivered using SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption.</p>
<p>SSL/TLS encrypts the connection between a user and a website, scrambling the data that is sent back and forth. Without SSL/TLS, someone one the same network can see data in clear text and, in this case, any password sent to CNBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worried about security? Enter your password into this @CNBC website (over HTTP, natch). What could go wrong,&#8221; Felt wrote on Twitter. &#8220;Alternately, feel free to tweet your password @ me and have the whole security community inspect it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The form also sent passwords to advertising networks and other parties with trackers on CNBC&#8217;s page, according to Ashkan Soltani, a privacy and security researcher, who posted a screenshot.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Despite saying the tool would not store passwords, traffic analysis showed it was actually storing them in a Google Docs spreadsheet, according to Kane York, who works on the Let&#8217;s Encrypt project.
