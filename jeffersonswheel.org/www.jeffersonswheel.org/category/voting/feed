As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.</p>
<p>
Our founding fathers faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.  Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>
